### A collection of my favorite Java projects that I have created.  
#### Combination of self-made, course work, and other projects.  
  
  
#### Minesweeper  

My favorite project I have created so far.  
Fully functioning Minesweeper game inside CLI.  

Implements flood fill algorithm to recursively fill out board 
As well as many fun nested for loops :)  

#### With a few small changes can operate very modular, allowing the user to choose their own board size.  

#### Project TODO: 
- [ ] Implement seperate version for this Repo with those changes  
- [ ] Freshen up the code as well as comments
