# A collection of my own favorite Java projects
#### Combination of self-made, course work, and other projects.

## [Minesweeper](/Minesweeper)  

Fully functioning Minesweeper game inside console.

Implements flood fill algorithm to recursively fill out board 
As well as many 'fun' nested for loops :)  

#### With a few small changes can operate very modular, allowing the user to choose their own board size.  

#### Project TODO: 
- [ ] Implement seperate version for this Repo with those changes  
- [ ] Freshen up the code as well as comments
